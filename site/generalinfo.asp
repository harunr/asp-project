                                        <p>Ricoh Travel Headquarters will make all air travel arrangements for you and your guest after we receive your Registration Form. You will receive an air itinerary via e-mail that requires your approval before we confirm your reservations. We will forward your airline seating requests to the airline for assignment. Seats are based on availability; however, we will do our best to accommodate your requests.</p>
                                        <p>If you choose to make your own airline reservations, you must ask the Ricoh Travel Department for the allowable round-trip fare from your home city to Catania-Fontanarossa Airport in Catania, Sicily. When making reservations, be aware there are no direct flights from the U.S. to Catania. Most carriers fly through Rome, Frankfurt or Munich, with connections to Catania.</p>
                                        <p>Because of inter-airline connections from the U.S. to Catania, you may experience longer layovers and be required to claim your luggage, go through Customs and re-check it at your connecting airport. Some airline schedules may require you to stay overnight in your connecting city.</p>
                                        <p>Ricoh will reimburse you the allowable fare, up to the actual cost of your tickets. You must provide your receipt for reimbursement. Ricoh does not reimburse if you use miles to obtain your tickets.</p>
                                        <p>Please note: you will depart your home city on Saturday, October 24, 2020, and arrive in Sicily on Sunday, October 25, 2020. At the end of the program, you will depart Sicily on Friday, October 30, 2020, and arrive in your home city the same day.</p>

                                                <p>Your trip to Sicily is at the end of the summer season, when daytime temperatures are quite comfortable. You may want to bring a light jacket for cool evenings and air-conditioned environments, and a hat and sunglasses for outdoors. After you choose your activities, check the descriptions for special attire requirements.</p>
<p>Keep these guidelines in mind when deciding what to pack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Casual clothing is suitable for most daytime activities. We strongly recommend comfortable walking shoes because you will likely do a lot of walking and the streets can be uneven.</li>
<li>When dining in upscale restaurants at night, smart casual attire such as slacks with collared shirts for gentlemen, and dresses, skirts or pants with light sweaters or blouses for ladies are appropriate. Gentlemen typically do not need jackets.</li>
<li>The theme for our evening event on Tuesday, October 27, 2020, is inspired by the movie, &ldquo;The Godfather.&rdquo; We encourage you to dress in 1940s-style attire, such as below-the-knee tailored dresses, T-strap shoes and cloche hats for ladies, and shawl-collar cardigans, trousers or knickers, bow ties, boater hats and oxford shoes for gentlemen. You do not need to wear a suit.</li>
<li>We recommend you leave nice jewelry at home. When touring and dining out, avoid putting expensive or important items in your back or outside pockets.</li>

Many shops close for the riposo (midafternoon siesta), though shops on main thoroughfares in big cities stay open through lunchtime. Most shops are generally open on Sundays and holidays.

To avoid surprises, we recommend you call your cell phone provider before the trip to confirm they offer service in Sicily and find the most cost-effective way to communicate while you are out of the country.</p>
                                                        <p>Typically, you incur charges only when you send or receive calls or texts, but data is handled differently. Smart phones are always looking for a network to get updates. Belmond Villa Sant&rsquo;Andrea offers complimentary standard Wi-Fi access in guestrooms and public areas. When you are outside the hotel, be sure to turn off data roaming. Otherwise, it will search for a network to receive updates, resulting in data charges.</p>

                                                            <p>Sicilian cuisine is a cultural cornucopia influenced by the Greeks, Romans, Arabs, French, Spanish and other civilizations that occupied the island over the centuries. It is almost impossible to characterize Sicily&rsquo;s food because it varies so much from the east to the center to the west and from town to town, but there are some common themes.</p>
                                                            <p>Sicily&rsquo;s pasta sauces are made with a variety of ingredients. The base is usually tomato or seafood, enriched with Arab influences of currants, dates, pine nuts or saffron or, in Greek style, with olives and capers. Wild fennel, celery, rosemary and other herbs from the wild macchia scrub add a distinct tang.</p>
                                                            <p>Seafood is the base of the Sicilian kitchen, with swordfish, tuna, octopus and bonito often used. Seafood is prepared in many different ways, often pounded into flat fillets and wrapped around a stuffing of breadcrumbs and herbs, called involtini. Sicily is famous for cheese, particularly fresh ricotta. Unlike the North American cow&rsquo;s milk variety, Sicilian ricotta comes from goat&rsquo;s milk and is aged to make the sharp pecorino. Another popular cheese is caciocavallo, made from cow&rsquo;s milk into little balls often seen hanging in shop windows.</p>

Most North American appliances using 110-120 volts AC cannot be used without a converter, which changes the voltage input into your appliance to run on 220 volts. You will need to pack a converter to use small appliances such as a curling iron. A converter changes the voltage that goes into your appliance. Using your device without a converter can damage it. You will only need an adapter plug to charge your cell phone, laptop or iPad. Adapter plugs do not convert voltage, they only change the configuration of the outlet.</p>

                                  <p>You do not need inoculations or vaccinations to enter Costa Rica. You should know, however, that like many countries around the world, Costa Rica has reported zika virus cases in the past. There are no known zika outbreaks there currently, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that pregnant women and couples planning a pregnancy within three months of traveling to Costa Rica consult a healthcare provider about the risks before deciding to take the trip. Ricoh cannot advise you on this personal matter. Click <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/zika-travel-information" target="_blank">here</a> for more information.</p>

                                        <p>The easiest way to get cash away from home is from an automated teller machine (ATM). You will find an ATM located just outside the main hotel and another one very close to the Post Office (3-minute walk from the hotel). Before you leave home, be sure you know your personal identification number (PIN) and confirm with your bank that it will work in Sicily. You will need a four-digit code; six digits will not work. Also ask about the daily withdrawal limit. Keep in mind that many banks impose a fee when you use a different bank&rsquo;s ATM, and fees can be higher (up to $5 or more) for international transactions. The bank from which you withdraw cash may also charge a fee.</p>
                                        <p>Credit and debit cards are safe ways to carry money and generally offer relatively good exchange rates. In Sicily, the most commonly accepted credit cards are MasterCard and Visa; next are American Express and Diners Club. When you use your credit card abroad, most banks apply a two percent fee above the one percent fee charged by Visa, MasterCard or American Express for currency conversion on credit charges. Nevertheless, credit cards may be the smart way to go when you factor in ATM fees.</p>
                                        <p>You can get cash advances on your credit card at an ATM, provided you know your PIN. Credit card companies try to protect themselves from theft by limiting the funds you can withdraw outside your home country, so call your credit card company for their limits before you leave home. Be aware that you will pay interest from the moment you withdraw cash, even if you pay your monthly bill on time. If you are unsure about using your credit card at an ATM for cash advances, ask for a cash advance (anticipo contanti) in person at an exchange bureau or bank in Sicily.</p>
                                        <p>We advise against taking travelers cheques, as it is very difficult to find a bank that will cash them.</p>

<p>Most places in Sicily are safe, but as always, you should always pay attention to your surroundings and keep belongings and money in a secure place, not in your back or outside pockets. For added safety, we recommend you leave valuables and passports in your hotel room safe when touring or participating in activities.</p>

                                        <p>As a member of the European Union (EU), Italy imposes a value-added tax (called IVA in Italy) on most goods and services. Non-EU citizens are entitled to a refund of the IVA if they spend more than 155 euros at any one store, before tax. For more information on the procedure, visit <a href="https://www.globalblue.com/tax-free-shopping/refund-calculator/">Global Blue</a>.</p>
                                        <p>Many shops are part of the "Tax Free for Tourists" network (look for the sticker in the window). After having your invoice stamped at Customs, you can redeem the check for cash at the Tax Free booth at Catania&ndash;Fontanarossa Airport or mail it back in the envelope provided within 60 days.</p>

                                        <p>In Sicily, the cost of providing good service is built into the price of goods and services, so large tips are not necessary and may appear ostentatious. When dining or touring on your own, it is fine to leave a few euros on the table for exceptional service or round up your cab fare to the next denomination to show your appreciation. Ricoh will take care of gratuities for hotel staff and tour operators on hosted activities.&nbsp;</p>
