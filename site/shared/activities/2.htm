                 <p>Mount Etna is the highest volcano in Europe and one of the most active in the world. It is an outstanding example of ongoing geological processes and volcanic formations&mdash;and one of the most impressive sights you may ever see!</p>
                <p>Your visit begins when you meet your guide and private minivan at the hotel and take a short drive on the freeway to Catania. At Giarre, you will leave the freeway and drive along scenic roads winding around the slopes of Mount Etna, passing the villages of Santa Venerina and Zafferana, fertile fields, vineyards and orchards. The road cuts through streams of solidified lava coming from the volcano and are remnants of past eruptions, the last of which was in October 2002.</p>
                <p>You will arrive at Mount Etna-Silvestri Crater at Sapienza Refuge, about 6,400 feet above sea level, where you can gaze across the Catania Gulf and the woods, orchards and vineyards below. From here, you will begin your exciting ascent to the upper part of the volcano by cable car and four-wheel-drive minivans. You will reach an altitude of about 8,800 feet, close to where the last crater opened up, and take a short walk among the craters.</p>
                <p>After the walk, your four-wheel-drive vehicle will take you down to about 6,200 feet, where you will board your minivan and drive to the Gambino Winery for wine tasting and a rustic Sicilian lunch before returning to the hotel.</p>
                <p>This tour goes to very high altitudes, where it can be 10-15 degrees colder than in Catania. The weather can change quickly and if it is cloudy or windy, it can feel even colder. The tour is subject to weather conditions.</p>
                <p>The walking portion of the tour is not particularly strenuous, but the air in high altitudes is thinner and can cause headaches, dizziness and shortness of breath, even if you are in excellent physical condition. Guests who have heart conditions or other health issues should not participate.</p>
